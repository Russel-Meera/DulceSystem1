Below is the **Client Use Case Diagram conversion**, expressed in a **formal, system-analysis format** that you can directly use for:

* UML Use Case Diagram drawing (StarUML, Draw.io, Lucidchart)
* Chapter III (System Design)
* SRS / Use Case Specification
* Oral defense explanation

Since I cannot draw a graphical UML diagram in this text channel, I will provide:

1. **Actor definition**
2. **Complete list of Client use cases**
3. **Use case groupings (modules)**
4. **Use case relationships** (include / extend)
5. **Exact diagram structure instructions** so you can recreate it accurately

Everything below is **strictly derived from the client pages you approved earlier** and the thesis scope.

# CLIENT USE CASE DIAGRAM – DULCE SYSTEM

---

## 1. ACTOR

### Primary Actor

**Client**

* Represents families or individuals availing funeral services
* Interacts with the system through a web browser
* Has no administrative privileges

There are **no secondary actors** involved on the client side (payment gateway is external and handled by the system, not directly by the client actor in UML).

---

## 2. CLIENT USE CASES (COMPLETE LIST)

These are **all use cases the Client actor can perform**.

---

### A. Account & Access Management

1. **Register Account**
2. **Login**
3. **Logout**
4. **Manage Profile**

   * View profile
   * Update profile information

---

### B. Service Browsing

5. **View Funeral Packages**
6. **View Home Services**
7. **View Announcements**
8. **View Obituaries**

---

### C. Booking & Scheduling

9. **Book Funeral Service**
10. **Select Funeral Package**
11. **Select Home Service**
12. **Select Schedule (Date & Time)**
13. **Submit Booking Request**
14. **View Booking Status**
15. **View Booking History**

---

### D. Deceased & Service Information

16. **Provide Deceased Information**
17. **View Submitted Service Details**

---

### E. Document Management

18. **Upload Required Documents**
19. **View Uploaded Documents**
20. **Track Document Status**

---

### F. Billing & Payments

21. **View Billing Information**
22. **Make Online Payment**
23. **Make Donation**
24. **View Payment Status**
25. **View Payment History**
26. **View / Download Receipt**

---

### G. Service Monitoring

27. **View Service Status Updates**

---

## 3. USE CASE GROUPING (SYSTEM BOUNDARY VIEW)

When drawn as a UML diagram, **all use cases are inside**:

> **System Boundary:**
> *DULCE: Integrated Funeral Service Management System*

Outside the boundary:

* Actor: **Client**

---

## 4. USE CASE RELATIONSHIPS (VERY IMPORTANT)

This section ensures your diagram is **academically correct**.

---

### A. «include» Relationships

(Used when a use case is **always part of another**)

* **Book Funeral Service**

  * «include» Select Funeral Package
  * «include» Select Home Service
  * «include» Select Schedule
  * «include» Provide Deceased Information
  * «include» Submit Booking Request

* **Make Online Payment**

  * «include» View Billing Information
  * «include» View Payment Status
  * «include» Generate Receipt *(system action, optional to show)*

---

### B. «extend» Relationships

(Used when a use case is **optional or conditional**)

* **Make Donation**

  * «extend» Make Online Payment

* **Upload Required Documents**

  * «extend» Book Funeral Service
    (only required if documents are needed for a booking)

---

### C. Authentication Dependency (Common Academic Pattern)

You may show:

* All secured use cases **require Login**

This can be modeled as:

* Note: *“Client must be logged in to access secured use cases”*
  OR
* «include» Login (optional, depending on diagram clarity)

Do **not** clutter the diagram by connecting Login to everything—this is usually explained in text.

---

## 5. FINAL UML DIAGRAM STRUCTURE (HOW TO DRAW IT)

### Step-by-step (for StarUML / Draw.io):

1. Draw **one actor** on the left:

   * Label: **Client**

2. Draw **one system boundary box**:

   * Title: *DULCE: Integrated Funeral Service Management System*

3. Inside the box, add use cases grouped logically:

   * Top: Account & Access
   * Middle: Booking & Services
   * Bottom: Payments & Documents

4. Connect:

   * Client → all primary use cases
   * Use «include» and «extend» where defined above

---

## 6. SIMPLIFIED TEXTUAL UML REPRESENTATION

You can include this in documentation if a figure is not required:

```
Actor: Client

Client → Register Account
Client → Login
Client → Manage Profile
Client → View Funeral Packages
Client → View Home Services
Client → Book Funeral Service
    «include» Select Funeral Package
    «include» Select Home Service
    «include» Select Schedule
    «include» Provide Deceased Information
    «include» Submit Booking Request
Client → Upload Required Documents
Client → View Booking Status
Client → View Service Status Updates
Client → View Billing Information
Client → Make Online Payment
    «extend» Make Donation
Client → View Payment History
Client → View Receipt
Client → View Announcements
Client → View Obituaries
Client → Logout
```

---

## 7. WHY THIS USE CASE DIAGRAM IS CORRECT

* Covers **100% of client functionalities**
* Matches the **client pages you approved**
* Uses **proper UML relationships**
* Aligns with **thesis-level academic standards**
* Ready for **diagramming and defense explanation**

---

### Next recommended step

The natural next move is:

* **Admin Use Case Diagram** (will be larger but structured similarly)
* OR **Client Use Case Specification** (detailed per use case: preconditions, flow, postconditions)

Tell me which one you want to do next.
